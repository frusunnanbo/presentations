1) I guess you all know about the problem. Our planet is slowly
heating, causing storms, heat waves, droughts and floods all around
the world.

2) I suppose you also know that there are some personal lifestyle
changes that you can do to help stopping climate change. Such as
flying less, eating less meat, bying less clothes etcetera. And that's
all fine. Do all that.

3) However, the problem is bigger than your personal lifestyle. So you
might ask yourself if there's something bigger you can do? And it
turns out that, as an IT professional you're part of an industry
responsible for a lot of carbon emissions.

4) How? Electricity. About two thirds of the electricity we use
world-wide comes from fossil fuel combustion. The rest renewable and
nuclear.

5) The IT industry is estimated to consume about 10% of the world's
electricity. It's used to power devices, networks and datacenters, and
to manufacture our equipment.

6) Since we're a large and growing electricity consumer, our choices
on how we power our equipment have a large influence on current and
future carbon emissons.

7) We're going to zoom into datacenters and how to power them
sustainably. First of all, we need to shrink this pipe, i.e. we want
to get as many useful computations as possible per electron.

8) One way of doing that is to move your services to the public
cloud. The big cloud providers have a much higher server utilization
rate than on prem servers.

9) There are variety of numbers published on how much energy you can save
by the move, ranging 40 to 90%. But either way, it's a lot.

10) So that all good, and a good start, but there's more. Our goal is
to close this pipe, and to do that we need to be able to get more
electricity from the green pipe.

11) We're going to look into what the three biggest cloud providers do
to support the transition to renewables. Because they have the power
to lead the way for our industry.

12) Let's start with Amazon. Their datacenters are powered by around
50% renewables, 50% fossil. They also claim that 5 of their regions
are carbon neutral.

13) How come? These regions are not 100% renewably powered, but to
cover for the fossil part that they consume, Amazon buys the
'greennes" off some electricity elsewhere by means of Renewable Energy
Certificates.

14) Buying these kind of certs is a decent but not perfect way of
offsetting carbon emissions.

15) Microsoft: Like Amazon, they've reached about 50% renewable power
for their datacenters. All of their datacenters are carbon
neutral, mostly by the same mechanism as Amazon uses.

16) Google: Like Microsoft, their business is 100% carbon neutral, but
they've chosen a more ambitious model. To be fair, Microsoft have done
some similar deals, but on a much smaller scale.

17) Their datacenters are connected to the normal power grid where
they're at, whatever the local energy mix happens to be. But for every
MWh they consume, they buy electricity AND 'greenness' from a
renewable power source.

18) Then they resell the electricity to the power grid but keep the
certs. Why? Because these deals are a better long-term incentive for
new green investments by the power companies.

19) Summary: Move your services to the cloud. Choose Google if you
can, otherwise choose Azure, and if that's not possible choose, a
carbon neutral region in Amazon.

20) Spread the word. Help putting pressure on the cloud providers, to
speed up effective investment in renewables. There's also a petition
which you should all sign right now.






84% power reduction (65% server utilization vs 15% + "29% less efficient"**) (1*)
40 % server utilization on average according to 4* 

** PUE below 1.2, vs 1.67 on on average (2*)


The other big cloud providers, Amazon and Google have presented similar reports ????



9) Data center usage is projected to increase five times by 2025
