1) Background:

Polar icecaps are melting. xxx of species are facing extinction. Small islands are sinking into the oceans with the rising sea levels.

Most of us realise by now that this is absolutely true and that we
need to to something about it. If you're in doubt about the truth of
these statements or about anything else I'll share with you in the
next five minutes, you'll find links to all of my sources on the end slide.

I'm not an expert, but I'm engaged and curious I've googled for
you. So now I'd like to share what I've learnt with you and hope that
you'll spread the word, because, we really need to do something about stuff.

2) What's that got to do with DevOps?

Most of you've probably heard about personal lifestyle changes you
could do to help, such as flying less or eating less red meat.

But as an IT professional, what can you do? That's the question I've
asked myself and others for a while now. I'll share some of the
answers I've found with you, hoping that you'll help implementing them
in your organizatons, or spreading the word, or just contacting me
after my 5 minutes on stage if you have more information. I'd love to
hear from you!

3) So what can I do as an IT professional?

My mind jumped immediately to the same kind of lifestyle choices that
we're recommended to make in our personal life, but extended to the
workplace. Like not drinking coffee out of paper cups, housing your
business in energy efficient buildings, avoiding printouts, invest in
good remote meeting gear to cut down of travelling. Not changing
computers and phones so often. And all of that's great and should be done.

But can't we do something bigger? Like implementing some really smart
software that would... help solar power plants of whatever. Well yeah
I guess, but at least I personnally don't know enough about solar
power to know how to make an impact with my programming skills.

But there's one "bigger" thing I know that we can actually impact as
IT professionals.

This is the carbon emissions from datacenters today. It's xxxx tonnes
CO2 per year, Y % of the total emissions. Yeah, it's just a small
piece. But every little helps, and the fact is that this little wedge
is actually as big as this, much debated wedge: Aviation.

4) So, datacenters.

What makes datacenters so dirty? IT is clean isn't? It doesn't
manufacture stuff in large factories spewing out greenhouse gases. It
doesn't transport heavy stuff by plane or car. We'll it does. All
equipment has to be manufactured and transported somehow, but let's
look at datacenters.

They consume electricity, a lot of it. According to a report from
Greenpeace from 2017, datacenters consume about 7 % of the worlds
electricity, and that figure is expected to keep rising over the next
few years.

But electricity is clean isn't it? Well, that depends on where it
comes from. ~65 % (3*) of the worlds electricity today is produced by
burning coal and other fossil fuels.

So, we have two tools for helping the climate:

1) Making those 7% smaller.
2) Moving them to renewable energy sources.

Or both!

5) So, how do we make the 7 % smaller?

Probably the easiest move is to stop hosting your own software,
whatever business you're in. Why? Because the big cloud providers are
much much better at optimising their energy usage to make as much of
it as possible go into actual computations and client requests
i.e. doing useful stuff, rather than go to cooling, heating, lighting
or idle servers.

Microsoft recently published a report stating that moving services to
their cloud could save as much as X % in terms of power consumption.

84% power reduction (65% server utilization vs 15% + "29% less efficient"**) (1*)
40 % server utilization on average according to 4* 

** PUE below 1.2, vs 1.67 on on average (2*)


The other big cloud providers, Amazon and Google have presented similar reports ????

6) OK, but what if I'd like those 7% not to be coal then?

That's a more complex issue. Lets say your choice of cloud provider is
Google, Microsoft and Amazon, because those are the big players right
now.

How clean are they, and how do their strategies and planned expansions
impact the CO2 emission levels now and in the future?

The good thing is that they've all committed to be powered by 100%
renewable energy by some future date. The difficult thing is that they
have different strategies and plans for reaching that goal, and it's
hard (avgöra) what is greenwashing and what really makes an impact on
global CO2 emissions.


6) Amazon

According to https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/:

50% renewable energy for 2018
100% commitment (for when?)
Several wind and solar projects.

393 g CO2/kWh 2015

Purchases and retires RECs and GoOs to cover non-renewables:
- US West
- Frankfurt
- Canada
- GovCloud
- Ireland

7) Google

8) Microsoft
